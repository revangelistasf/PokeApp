# PokeApp

- I read the pokeAPI documentation to understand how I would have to fetch the Pokemon list

- starting a simple version of the project, using tableView to test my network class

- refactor the Pokemon model with the attributes Iâ€™ll show on details screen and change the table view to collection view

- I refactor the Pokemon api calls to make it as encapsulate as possible, add method to do new requests for the pagination

- I change my approach and install nuke to deal with the Pokemon images and cache

- Add colours to change based on Pokemon type
